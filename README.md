# Char-level RNN names generation 

I've created this project for educational purpose.
If you want to experiment with other languages, just add the file with data in the appropriate format in `data/dir/file_name.txt` and 
 specify the path in the `train.py` file.
 
 Installation:
 - Before running make sure you have installed `pipenv`.
 - pipenv install
 - You have to install pyTorch manually via PIP due to current problems with install pyTorch via Pipenv,
 `pip install torch` should do the work
